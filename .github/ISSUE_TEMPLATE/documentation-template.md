The following sections are required when creating a documentation issue:
1. **Subject** - A statement on what needs to be documented and why, in as much detail as possible. If possible, give a name for the document here. If the issue is in reference to an existing piece of documentation, make sure it is referenced correctly, in particular with regards to the name and section of the referenced document and give a link if possible.
2. **Location** - Specify where the document should be kept. This can be a wiki entry, github/gitlab repository or similar. If the requested piece of documentation is a part of another document, reference that document here.
