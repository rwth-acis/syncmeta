The sections for an enhancement issue are:

1. **Motivation** - A description of the context of the new feature. Answers questions such as: "What is the new feature?", "Why do we need it?/What are we lacking?/What benefits does it bring?", "How does it fit with the rest of the system?".
2. **Specification** - A detailed list of what needs to be done in order to complete the issue. 
3. **Finalised state** - A definition of the state of the system when the feature is implemented and fully integrated. Here it should be described how the system will function with the new feature included.
